# Team Collaboration — 團隊合作與內部溝通英## Dialogue Examples — 實際對話範例

### 📋 任務切分與依賴
**情境**：Sprint 規劃會議中的工作分配

**Lead**: Let's split the epic into three stories: API, UI, and QA automation. Owners?

**Dev A (Sarah)**: I'll take API, but I need the schema from the data team first.

**Dev B (Mike)**: I can own UI; will sync with design on the mockups.

**QA (Lisa)**: I'll draft the test plan and set up the automation framework.

**Lead**: Great. Sarah, when do you need the schema?

**Sarah**: By Wednesday to start coding on Thursday.

**Lead**: I'll escalate the schema request today.

### 🚨 進度風險通報
**情境**：每日站會中的阻礙討論

**Dev A**: I'm yellow—blocked on access to the staging database.

**Lead**: I'll escalate to infrastructure and keep you posted. Anything else blocking?

**Dev B**: All good on my side. I can help with testing once the DB issue is resolved.

**QA**: The test environment is ready when you are.

**Lead**: Thanks everyone. I'll have an update on DB access by noon.

### 🎯 Sprint 回顧會議
**情境**：團隊檢討上一個 Sprint 的表現

**Scrum Master**: What went well this sprint?

**Developer**: The new code review process caught issues early.

**QA**: Communication was great—no last-minute surprises.

**Scrum Master**: What could we improve?

**Developer**: Estimates were off. We need to account for integration testing time.

**Product Owner**: I can provide requirements earlier to help with estimation.

### 🏆 團隊表揚
**情境**：公開認可團隊成員的貢獻

**Manager**: I want to recognize Sarah for her work on the authentication service. She not only delivered on time but also documented everything for future developers.

**Sarah**: Thanks! The documentation was actually suggested by the team during our retro.

**Colleague**: Sarah also helped debug my API integration. Really appreciated the pair programming session.

**Manager**: That collaborative spirit is exactly what we value here.

### 🔄 工作交接
**情境**：團隊成員之間的工作交接

**Outgoing Developer**: I'm transitioning the payment service to you. Here's what you need to know.

**Incoming Developer**: Thanks. What's the current status?

**Outgoing**: Feature complete, but there's a known issue with refunds that needs investigation. I've documented it in the GitHub issue.

**Incoming**: Got it. Who should I contact for payment provider questions?

**Outgoing**: Lisa from the finance team. She's the domain expert and very responsive.

### 🤝 跨團隊協作
**情境**：工程團隊與產品團隊的合作討論

**Product Manager**: We need to add analytics tracking to the new feature.

**Tech Lead**: No problem. What events do you want to track?

**Product Manager**: User clicks, page views, and conversion funnel steps.

**Tech Lead**: I'll add the tracking hooks. Do you have the event schema ready?

**Product Manager**: I'll send it today. When can you implement?

**Tech Lead**: If the schema is clear, we can deploy by Friday.

### 🎨 設計與開發協作
**情境**：設計師與開發者的協作溝通

**Designer**: The button hover state isn't matching the design. Could we adjust the color?

**Developer**: Sure. What hex code should I use?

**Designer**: #3B82F6 instead of the current blue. Also, the transition should be 200ms.

**Developer**: Perfect. I'll update that and push a new build to staging.

**Designer**: Great! I'll review it this afternoon and give feedback. Vocabulary
- assign/owner 任務分派/負責：assign, DRI, owner
- handoff 交接：handoff notes, knowledge transfer
- sync/async 同步/非同步：standup, status update, thread
- escalation 升級處理：escalate, unblock
- alignment 對齊：align on goals, alignment check
- recognition 表揚：shout-out, recognition, kudos
- retro 檢討：retrospective, action items

## Useful Patterns
- 任務分派與協調：
  - Assigning [task] to [name] with an ETA of [date].
  - Let’s clarify owners and dependencies before we start.
- 進度匯報：
  - Status: [green/yellow/red]; risks include … next steps are …
  - We’re on track, pending approval from …
- 問題討論與解決：
  - Proposed options are A/B; I recommend A because …
  - Could someone help unblock the access to …?
- 鼓勵與表揚：
  - Shout-out to [name] for [contribution].
  - Appreciate the extra effort to make the deadline.

## Context Examples
- 站會：
  - “No blockers; pairing with Sam on the integration tests.” 無阻礙，與 Sam 配對寫整合測試。
- 跨組協作：
  - “Looping in data team to validate the metrics definition.” 把資料團隊拉進來確認指標定義。
- 表揚：
  - “Kudos to the support team for the quick turnaround.” 感謝客服團隊迅速支援。

## Dialogue Examples — 實際對話範例

### 任務切分與依賴
Lead: Let’s split the epic into three stories: API, UI, and QA automation. Owners?
Dev A: I’ll take API, but I need the schema from data.
Dev B: I can own UI; will sync with design.
QA: I’ll draft the test plan and set up the environment.

### 進度風險通報
Dev A: I’m yellow—blocked on access to the staging DB.
Lead: I’ll escalate to infra and keep you posted. Anything else blocking?
Dev B: All good on my side.

## Mini Drills
- 寫一段任務分派訊息（含 owner、ETA、依賴）。
- 將模糊讚美改為具體表揚（含貢獻與影響）。

## Quick Reference — 中英雙語卡
- Assigning [task] to [name] with ETA [date]. 指派[任務]給[name]，預計[date]。
- Status is yellow due to [risk]. 因為[risk]，狀態為黃。
- Could someone help unblock…? 可以請人協助排除…嗎？
- Shout-out to [name] for… 感謝[name]的…
- Let’s align on owners and dependencies. 先對齊負責人與依賴項。
