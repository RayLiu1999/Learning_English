### 📦 出貨延遲致歉

**Customer**: My order was due yesterday and still hasn't arrived.

**Support (Lisa)**: I'm sorry about the delay. I've checked the tracking—there was a sorting error at the hub. We've upgraded your shipping at no cost and it should arrive tomorrow. I'll monitor it and update you if anything changes.

**Customer**: I appreciate the upgrade. Will I get a confirmation when it ships?

### 🔧 技術問題排查

**情境**：應用程式功能異常需要逐步診斷

**Customer**: The app keeps logging me out.

**Support (Mike)**: That's frustrating—I hear you. Could you tell me your OS and app version? I'll also check for known incidents while we troubleshoot together.

**Customer**: iOS 17.2, app version 3.1.4.

**Support**: Thanks. I don't see any widespread issues. Let's try clearing the app cache first. Go to Settings > Storage > Clear Cache, then restart the app.

**Customer**: Tried that, still happening.

**Support**: Let me escalate this to our engineering team. Can you send me a screenshot when it logs you out? That'll help them diagnose faster.

### 💳 善意補償

**情境**：服務中斷影響客戶業務需要補償

**Customer**: We missed our internal deadline because of this outage.

**Support (Sarah)**: I understand the impact on your business—that's not acceptable. Besides resolving the issue, we can offer a service credit on your next invoice. I'll include details in a follow-up email.

**Customer**: What percentage of credit are we talking about?

**Support**: For a 4-hour outage, we typically offer a full day's credit, which is about 25% of your monthly fee. I'll also add priority support for the next 30 days.

### 🔄 產品功能請求

**情境**：客戶希望新增特定功能

**Customer**: Can you add a bulk export feature? We need to download 10,000 records monthly.

**Support (Tom)**: That's great feedback. Currently, our export limit is 1,000 records per request. Let me log this as a feature request and connect you with our product team.

**Customer**: When might this be available?

**Support**: I can't promise a timeline, but I'll make sure the product team understands your use case. In the meantime, would API access work for bulk operations?

### 🏷️ 定價與計費問題

**情境**：客戶對賬單有疑問需要解釋

**Customer**: I was charged twice for the same month. Can you explain?

**Support (Anna)**: Let me pull up your account. I see the issue—there was an overlap between your trial ending and annual subscription starting. The double charge is an error on our end.

**Customer**: How long for the refund?

**Support**: I'm processing the refund now. You'll see it in 3-5 business days. I'm also adding a note to prevent this from recurring.

**Support (David)**: Absolutely understood. We're SOC 2 certified and HIPAA compliant. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest using AES-256. I'll send you our security whitepaper and compliance certificates.

**Customer**: Do you have a BAA available?

**Support**: Yes, I'll forward our Business Associate Agreement template. Our legal team can review any modifications you need.
