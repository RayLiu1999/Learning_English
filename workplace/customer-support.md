### 📦 出貨延遲致歉
**情境**：物流問題導致客戶訂單延遲

**Customer**: My order was due yesterday and still hasn't arrived.

**Support (Lisa)**: I'm sorry about the delay. I've checked the tracking—there was a sorting error at the hub. We've upgraded your shipping at no cost and it should arrive tomorrow. I'll monitor it and update you if anything changes.

### 🔧 技術問題排查
**情境**：應用程式功能異常需要逐步診斷

**Customer**: The app keeps logging me out.

**Customer**: iOS 17.2, app version 3.1.4.

**Support**: Thanks. I don't see any widespread issues. Let's try clearing the app cache first. Go to Settings > Storage > Clear Cache, then restart the app.

**Customer**: Tried that, still happening.

**Support**: Let me escalate this to our engineering team. Can you send me a screenshot when it logs you out? That'll help them diagnose faster.

### 💳 善意補償
**情境**：服務中斷影響客戶業務需要補償

**Customer**: What percentage of credit are we talking about?

**Customer**: When might this be available?

**Support**: I can't promise a timeline, but I'll make sure the product team understands your use case. In the meantime, would API access work for bulk operations?

### 🏷️ 定價與計費問題
**情境**：客戶對賬單有疑問需要解釋

**Customer**: I was charged twice for the same month. Can you explain?

**Support (Anna)**: Let me pull up your account. I see the issue—there was an overlap between your trial ending and annual subscription starting. The double charge is an error on our end.

**Customer**: How long for the refund?
