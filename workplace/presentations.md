### 💼 投資人更新簡報（開場與過場）

**Presenter**: Slightly lower—trial mix changed. I'll show the cohort view on the next slide.

**Investor B**: What's driving the partnership success?

### ❓ Q&A 段落
**情境**：技術簡報後的問答環節

**Audience Member**: What's the biggest risk to hitting the Q1 target?

**Presenter (CTO)**: Supplier lead time. We've added a buffer and a second vendor. Worst case, we slip one week.

**Audience Member**: What about security considerations?

**Presenter**: All data is encrypted end-to-end, and we're SOC 2 compliant. I'll share the security whitepaper after this session.

### 🎯 收尾行動

**Presenter (Sales Engineer)**: Let me show you how this solves your workflow challenge. I'm sharing my screen now—can everyone see the dashboard?

**Client**: Yes, looks clear.

**Presenter**: Great. So you mentioned manual report generation takes 2 hours. With our new automation, watch this... *demonstrates feature* ...and we're done in 30 seconds.

**Client**: That's impressive. Can it handle our data volume?

**Presenter**: Absolutely. We've tested with datasets 10x your size. Plus, it scales automatically.

### 💡 提案簡報
**情境**：向管理層提出新項目提案

**Presenter (Project Manager)**: I'm proposing we invest in automated testing. Current manual testing takes 3 days per release.
