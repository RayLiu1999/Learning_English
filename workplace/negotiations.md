## Dialogue Examples — 實際對話範例

### 💰 價格與合約長度

**情境**：B2B 軟體服務的價格談判

**Client**: We can't commit to a year at this price.

**Sales**: If we start with a six-month pilot at a lower rate, and convert to annual upon success, would that de-risk it for you?

**Client**: That sounds reasonable. What success criteria would you propose?

**Sales**: Uptime above 99.9% and time-to-resolution under two hours for Sev-1 issues. Plus 20% improvement in your team's productivity metrics.

**Client**: The productivity metrics are hard to measure. Could we focus on uptime and response time?

**Sales**: Absolutely. Those are objective and in our control.

### 🤝 內部跨部門協商

**情境**：產品團隊與客服團隊的功能優先順序討論

**PM**: To hit the launch date, we need to push analytics to later.

**CS Lead**: Support needs analytics for training. Could we ship a lightweight version first?

**PM**: Yes, a basic dashboard in v1, advanced analytics in v2. What's the minimum you need?

**CS Lead**: User activity logs and basic metrics. Nothing fancy.

**PM**: Perfect. That's maybe 3 days of work versus 3 weeks for the full version.

### 🏢 供應商談判

**情境**：與供應商討論服務條款和 SLA

**Buyer**: Your standard SLA is 4 hours response time, but we need 1 hour for critical issues.

**Vendor**: We can do 1-hour response for an additional 15% fee, or you can upgrade to our premium tier.

**Buyer**: What else comes with the premium tier?

**Vendor**: Dedicated account manager, priority support queue, and monthly business reviews.

**Buyer**: If we commit to a 3-year contract, could you include premium at the standard rate?

**Vendor**: For 3 years, yes. We'd need quarterly payments instead of annual.

### 💼 薪資談判

**情境**：員工與主管的薪資調整討論

**Employee**: I'd like to discuss my compensation. Market research shows I'm 15% below market rate.

**Manager**: I appreciate you bringing data. What sources did you use?

**Employee**: Glassdoor, PayScale, and two recruiters confirmed the range. I've also taken on additional responsibilities this year.

**Manager**: You're right about the extra work. Let me see what budget flexibility we have. Could we schedule a follow-up next week?

**Employee**: Absolutely. I'm also interested in discussing the promotion timeline.

### 🏠 租約談判

**情境**：辦公室租約條款的商業談判

**Tenant Rep**: The rent increase is steep. Could we explore alternatives?

**Landlord**: The market has moved up significantly. What did you have in mind?

**Tenant Rep**: A longer lease term in exchange for stable rates. Say 7 years at current rate plus 2% annually.

**Landlord**: That's below market, but the certainty is valuable. What about building improvements?

**Tenant Rep**: We'd handle interior improvements, you maintain base building systems.

### 🤝 合作夥伴協議

**情境**：兩家公司的策略合作談判

**Company A**: We're interested in a revenue-sharing partnership for the integration.

**Company B**: What split are you thinking?

**Company A**: 70-30, given we're providing the customer base.

**Company B**: Our technology is the differentiator. How about 60-40 with us as the tech provider?

**Company A**: Fair point. Could we tier it based on volume? 70-30 for first $1M, then 60-40 above that?

**Company B**: That works. It aligns incentives for growth.
