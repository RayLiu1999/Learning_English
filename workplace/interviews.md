### 👤 自我介紹片段
**情境**：面試開始的標準自我介紹

### 🎯 行為面試（衝突解決）
**情境**：使用 STAR 方法回答行為問題

**Interviewer**: Describe a conflict with a teammate and how you handled it.

**Candidate**: Situation: We disagreed on database choice for a new service. Task: I needed to resolve this to keep the project on track. Action: I proposed a spike to test both options with our workload and documented the trade-offs. Result: The results favored Postgres; we documented the decision and moved forward with team alignment.

**Interviewer**: How did your teammate react to the data?

**Candidate**: Initially resistant, but the performance benchmarks were clear. We both learned something and now use this approach for other technical decisions.

### 🧠 技術面試
**情境**：技術能力評估和系統設計

**Interviewer**: How would you design a URL shortener like bit.ly?

**Interviewer**: How would you handle 1 billion URLs?
