**Team Member C**: Perfect! I can bring some new games I got for my birthday.

**HR Rep**: What about areas for improvement?

**B**: Speaking of books, have you tried any good podcasts lately? I'm always looking for recommendations.

**Mentor**: That's a great goal. Our customer success team sometimes needs technical backup for complex issues.

**Mentee**: That sounds perfect! How could I get involved?

**Mentor**: I'll introduce you to their manager. You could start by shadowing calls and gradually take on more responsibility.

**Mentee**: I'd love that opportunity. Should I prepare anything specific?

**B**: Of course! It's about the triumph of light over darkness. We light lamps, share sweets, and spend time with family.
