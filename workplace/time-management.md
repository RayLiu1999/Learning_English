# Time Management & Scheduling — ## Dialogue Examples — 實際對話範例

### ⏰ 會議排程協調
**情境**：跨時區團隊安排會議時間

**Project Manager**: Could we lock a 30-minute slot next Tuesday for the design review? I'm free 10–12 UTC.

**Designer (EU)**: Let's do 10:30 UTC—that works perfectly on my side. Should we include the engineering lead?

**PM**: Yes, let me check with Sarah in Pacific time. That would be 3:30 AM for her.

**Engineer (US)**: Can we move it to 4 PM UTC? That's 9 AM for me and still reasonable for Europe.

**Designer**: 5 PM is getting late for me, but I can make it work. Let's confirm that time.

**PM**: Perfect, invite sent with Zoom link and agenda attached.

### 🚨 優先順序緊急調整
**情境**：生產事故影響原定工作計劃

**Manager**: We have a critical production incident affecting checkout. Please pause new feature work and focus on the fix.

**Engineer**: Understood. I was halfway through the user profile enhancement. Should I commit my current work?

**Manager**: Yes, create a WIP commit and switch to the incident. What's your estimate for the fix?

**Engineer**: Initial investigation suggests 2-3 hours. I'll update the timeline for the profile feature accordingly.

**Manager**: Keep me posted every hour. I'll notify stakeholders about the delay.

**Engineer**: Will do. I'll also notify the QA team that today's testing session needs to be postponed.

### 📅 截止日期重新評估
**情境**：發現原定時程過於樂觀，需要調整期望

**Stakeholder**: Is the Q3 launch still on track for September 15th?

**Team Lead**: I need to be honest—we're facing some challenges. The third-party integration is more complex than anticipated.

**Stakeholder**: What's a realistic timeline?

**Team Lead**: With proper testing and QA, we're looking at October 1st. We could hit September 15th but would sacrifice quality.

**Stakeholder**: What are the specific blockers?

**Team Lead**: API documentation was incomplete, and we discovered compliance requirements that add 2 weeks for security review.

**Stakeholder**: Options for mitigation?

**Team Lead**: We could launch core features by September 15th and add the integration in a follow-up release.

### ⚡ 工作量分配討論
**情境**：Sprint計劃中評估團隊容量和任務分配

**Scrum Master**: Looking at our velocity, we can take on 32 story points this sprint. What are the priorities?

**Product Owner**: The user authentication overhaul is highest priority at 13 points.

**Developer**: That's a large item. Can we break it down into smaller deliverables?

**PO**: Good idea. Login improvements could be 5 points, and registration flow another 8 points.

**Scrum Master**: That leaves us 19 points. The API rate limiting feature is 8 points—should we include it?

**Tech Lead**: Yes, but let's keep 3 points buffer for bug fixes. We had several hotfixes last sprint.

**Scrum Master**: Agreed. So authentication improvements, API rate limiting, and 3 points for maintenance.

### 🔄 進度追蹤與更新
**情境**：Weekly standup中討論任務進展

**Scrum Master**: Let's go around the room. Mike, how's the database migration going?

**Mike**: 70% complete. Hit a snag with data validation, but found a solution. Should finish by Thursday.

**Scrum Master**: Any blockers?

**Mike**: I'll need DevOps help for the production deployment. Can we schedule that for Friday?

**DevOps Lead**: Sure, I'll block Friday afternoon. Do you need a rollback plan?

**Mike**: Yes, I'll prepare the rollback scripts and test them in staging first.

**Scrum Master**: Sarah, your status on the mobile UI updates?

**Sarah**: Designs are approved, coding is 60% done. On track for Monday delivery.

### 📈 容量規劃會議
**情境**：季度計劃中評估團隊資源和項目優先級

**Engineering Manager**: Q4 planning: we have 3 engineers and 12 weeks. What are the must-haves?

**Product Manager**: Mobile app launch is non-negotiable—board commitment. That's probably 6-7 weeks.

**EM**: That leaves 5-6 weeks for other initiatives. What's next priority?

**PM**: Performance improvements. Page load times are affecting conversion rates.

**EM**: Performance work is ongoing—we can parallelize some of it with mobile development.

**PM**: How about the new reporting dashboard?

**EM**: That's 4-5 weeks if we reuse existing components. It could fit, but we'd need to nail down requirements early.

**PM**: I'll have detailed requirements by next Friday. Let's plan for that.

### 🎯 個人時間管理
**情境**：一對一會議中討論工作效率和時間分配

**Manager**: How are you feeling about your workload lately? You seem stretched thin.

**Engineer**: I'm managing, but context switching between projects is challenging. Hard to get into deep work.

**Manager**: What's causing the most interruptions?

**Engineer**: Slack notifications and ad-hoc support requests. I spend 2-3 hours daily on unplanned work.

**Manager**: Let's try some strategies. How about dedicated focus time with Slack off?

**Engineer**: I'd love morning focus blocks—I'm most productive then.

**Manager**: Great. Let's block 9-11 AM daily for deep work. And we'll rotate support duties weekly instead of daily.

**Engineer**: That would help tremendously. Should I communicate this schedule to the team?

**Manager**: Yes, add it to your calendar and mention it in next week's team meeting.文大全

## Core Vocabulary
- schedule 排程：schedule, availability, time slot
- deadline 截止：deadline, due date, slip
- priority 優先：priority, reprioritize, trade-off
- timebox 控時：timebox, buffer, overrun
- reschedule 改期：reschedule, postpone, bring forward
- ETA 預計完成：ETA, EOD/COB, EOW
- follow-up 跟進：follow up, reminder

## Useful Patterns
- 預約會議：
  - Could you share your availability next week?
  - Proposing [date/time]—does that work for you?
- 討論截止日期：
  - Given the scope, a realistic deadline is [date].
  - We may slip by a day due to [reason].
- 調整優先順序：
  - I’ll reprioritize X over Y to meet the deadline.
  - To hit the date, we need to descoped [items].
- 跟進與提醒：
  - Friendly reminder on the doc review—due EOD today.
  - Circling back to check if you had a chance to look.

## Context Examples
- 行程確認：
  - “Let’s lock in 3 PM Thursday; invite sent.” 確認週四 3 點，邀請已送。
- 時程評估：
  - “With QA and security review, we’ll need an extra two days.” 加上 QA 與資安審查需多兩天。
- 優先順序：
  - “Product asks to prioritize bug fixes over new features this sprint.” 本次衝刺先修 bug 再做新功能。

## Dialogue Examples — 實際對話範例

### 排程協調
Planner: Could we lock a 30-minute slot next Tuesday? I’m free 10–12 UTC.
Partner: Let’s do 10:30 UTC—works on my side.
Planner: Perfect, invite sent.

### 優先順序重排
Manager: We have a production incident. Please pause new feature work and focus on the fix.
Engineer: Understood. I’ll update the timeline and notify stakeholders.

## Mini Drills
- 寫三句禮貌改期。
- 把一段含糊的時程承諾改寫成具體 ETA 與風險說明。

## Quick Reference — 中英雙語卡
- Could you share your availability next week? 可否分享你下週的時段？
- Proposing [date/time]—does that work? 提議[日期/時間]，可以嗎？
- The realistic deadline is [date]. 合理的截止日期是[日期]。
- I’ll reprioritize X over Y. 我會把 X 提前於 Y。
- Friendly reminder—due EOD. 溫馨提醒—今天下班前到期。
