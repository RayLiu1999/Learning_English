## Dialogue Examples — 實際對話範例

### ⏰ 會議排程協調

**情境**：跨時區團隊安排會議時間

**Project Manager**: Could we lock a 30-minute slot next Tuesday? I'm free 10–12 UTC.

**Designer (EU)**: Let's do 10:30 UTC—that works on my side.

**Engineer (US)**: Can we move it to 4 PM UTC? That's 9 AM for me.

**PM**: Perfect, invite sent with Zoom link and agenda attached.

### 🚨 優先順序緊急調整

**情境**：生產事故影響原定工作計劃

**Manager**: We have a critical production incident. Please pause new feature work and focus on the fix.

**Engineer**: Understood. What's the priority level?

**Manager**: P0—everything else is on hold. Keep me posted every hour.

**Engineer**: Will do. I'll notify the QA team about the delay.

### 📅 截止日期重新評估

**情境**：發現原定時程過於樂觀

**Stakeholder**: Is the Q3 launch still on track for September 15th?

**Team Lead**: We're facing challenges. The integration is more complex than anticipated. Realistic timeline is October 1st.

**Stakeholder**: Options for mitigation?

**Team Lead**: We could launch core features by September 15th and add the integration in a follow-up release.

### ⚡ 工作量分配討論

**情境**：Sprint 計劃中評估團隊容量

**Scrum Master**: We have 32 story points capacity. What are the priorities?

**Product Owner**: User authentication is highest at 13 points.

**Developer**: Can we break it down? Login 5 points, registration 8 points.

**Scrum Master**: Let's also keep 3 points buffer for bug fixes.

### 🎯 個人時間管理

**情境**：一對一會議中討論工作效率

**Manager**: How are you feeling about your workload? You seem stretched thin.

**Engineer**: Context switching is challenging. I spend 2-3 hours daily on unplanned work.

**Manager**: Let's try dedicated focus time. Block 9-11 AM daily for deep work.

**Engineer**: That would help. I'll add it to my calendar and notify the team.

## Mini Drills

1. **寫三句禮貌改期**
2. **把含糊的時程改寫成具體 ETA 與風險說明**
3. **準備優先順序對話**：說明為何某任務要延後
