### 🎯 產品路線會議：開場與對齊
**情境**：季度規劃會議，需要在有限資源下做優先順序決策

**Chair (Alex - Product Director)**: Thanks for joining. Today's objective is to align on the Q1 roadmap. We'll cover scope, sequencing, and owners.

**PM (Sarah)**: To set the context, customer churn rose in SMB. I propose prioritizing self-serve onboarding before analytics.

**Eng Lead (Mark)**: From an effort standpoint, onboarding is simpler and unblocks other work.

### 💬 建設性反對與停車場（Parking Lot）
**情境**：團隊成員有不同觀點需要討論

**Designer (Emma)**: I'm partially aligned. Without basic analytics, onboarding won't show value. Could we timebox a minimal dashboard?

**Chair**: Good debate. Let's park "advanced analytics" in the parking lot and proceed with a minimal dashboard in this phase.

**PM**: That compromise works. Minimal dashboard gives us basic metrics without delaying onboarding.

### ⚡ 收尾與行動項
**情境**：會議結束前確認決策與責任分工

**Chair**: Summarizing decisions: 1) Onboarding first, 2) Minimal dashboard, 3) Pricing tests later. Owners: PM for spec Fri, Eng for estimate Mon. Any objections?

**Chair**: Great. I'll send meeting notes and schedule the follow-up for next Tuesday.

### 🔄 每週站會
**情境**：快節奏的團隊同步會議

**Scrum Master**: Let's start our standup. Sarah, go ahead.

**Sarah (Developer)**: Yesterday I finished the API authentication. Today I'm integrating with the frontend. I need to sync with David on token format after this.

**David (Frontend)**: I can walk you through that. The spec is in my PR, but happy to clarify any questions.

**Tom (QA)**: I'll need the dev environment updated with the new auth flow to start testing.

**Scrum Master**: Any blockers?

**Sarah**: No blockers, just the sync with David.

**David**: Same here. I'll ping you after standup, Sarah.

### 🚨 緊急問題討論
**情境**：生產問題需要快速決策

**Engineer**: We lose the new fraud detection, but payments work.

**Chair**: Customer impact is priority. Let's rollback now and schedule the fix for next week.
