# Performance Feedback & 1:1 — 績效## Dialogue Examples — 實際對話範例

### 🌟 正向回饋 (SBI模型)
**情境**：經理向團隊成員提供具體的正面回饋

**Manager**: I wanted to give you some feedback about yesterday's client call. When you summarized the technical issue, you broke it down into simple terms and offered three clear solutions.

**Engineer**: Thanks! I was worried it might be too detailed.

**Manager**: Actually, it was perfect. The client visibly relaxed when they understood the problem, and they immediately approved our proposed timeline. Your clear communication directly saved the project.

**Engineer**: I appreciate that feedback. I'll continue using that approach of breaking complex issues into digestible parts.

**Manager**: Exactly. It's a real strength that helps build client confidence.

### 🔧 建設性回饋 (COIN模型)
**情境**：提供改進建議的回饋對話

**Manager**: I'd like to discuss last week's product demo. I noticed the presentation ran 15 minutes over, which cut our Q&A session short.

**Developer**: You're right, I got carried away with the technical details.

**Manager**: The content was excellent, but timing is crucial for keeping the audience engaged. For next time, could we rehearse with a timer and allocate specific minutes to each section?

**Developer**: That makes sense. Should I prepare shorter technical explanations?

**Manager**: Focus on high-level benefits first, then dive into technical details only if they ask. We could also prepare a follow-up document for technical depth.

**Developer**: I'll practice with the timer and tighten my transitions between sections.

### 📊 季度績效檢討
**情境**：一對一績效檢討會議

**Manager**: Let's review your Q3 objectives. You exceeded the customer satisfaction target by 15% and delivered all projects on time.

**Employee**: Thank you. I'm particularly proud of the client feedback on the migration project.

**Manager**: That was outstanding work. Where do you feel you could have performed better?

**Employee**: I struggled with the cross-team communication early in the quarter. Some delays could have been avoided.

**Manager**: I noticed that too, but you improved significantly after we discussed it. The stakeholder updates in September were much clearer.

**Employee**: The weekly summary format really helped. I'd like to work on public speaking for Q4.

**Manager**: Great goal. We can enroll you in the presentation skills workshop and have you present at the monthly all-hands.

### 🎯 目標設定與對齊
**情境**：設定明確的季度目標和期望

**Director**: For Q4, I'd like you to take ownership of the API redesign project. This is a high-visibility initiative.

**Senior Developer**: I'm excited about that. What are the key success metrics?

**Director**: Three main goals: deliver the new API by December 15th, achieve 99.9% backward compatibility, and reduce response times by 40%.

**Developer**: The timeline is tight. Would I have dedicated resources?

**Director**: You'll lead a team of three developers and have priority access to the DevOps team for infrastructure changes.

**Developer**: What about stakeholder management?

**Director**: I'll handle executive communication, but you'll own technical stakeholder updates and coordinate with product management.

**Developer**: That clarity helps. I'll draft a project plan by Friday.

### 💡 成長機會討論
**情境**：討論職業發展和技能提升

**Employee**: I'd like to discuss my career progression. I'm interested in moving toward a tech lead role.

**Manager**: That's a natural next step for you. What specific skills do you think you need to develop?

**Employee**: I feel confident technically, but I need more experience with mentoring and architectural decisions.

**Manager**: Good self-awareness. How about we start by having you mentor our new junior developer?

**Employee**: I'd love that. Any other opportunities?

**Manager**: The mobile platform redesign needs someone to own the architecture. It's a six-month project with high impact.

**Employee**: That sounds perfect for developing those skills. When would it start?

**Manager**: January. We could also have you represent the team in the monthly architecture review meetings.

**Employee**: Excellent. Should I start attending as an observer first?

### 🔄 進度追蹤檢討
**情境**：中期檢查專案進度和個人表現

**Manager**: How are you feeling about progress on the customer portal redesign?

**Developer**: Good overall, but I'm concerned about the integration complexity. It's taking longer than estimated.

**Manager**: What specific challenges are you facing?

**Developer**: The legacy API doesn't match our new data model. I'm spending a lot of time on data transformation.

**Manager**: Have you considered building an adapter layer instead of transforming everything inline?

**Developer**: That's interesting. It might simplify the code and make testing easier.

**Manager**: Also, don't hesitate to ask for help. The senior team has dealt with similar integration challenges.

**Developer**: I'll consult with David—he worked on the last major API integration.

**Manager**: Perfect. Let's check in again next week to see how the adapter approach is working.

### 🛠️ 改進計劃制定
**情境**：針對具體表現問題制定改進策略

**Manager**: I want to discuss the recent production incident. Walk me through what happened from your perspective.

**Engineer**: I deployed the fix without running the full test suite. I was focused on getting it out quickly.

**Manager**: I understand the pressure to move fast. What could have prevented the issue?

**Engineer**: Definitely should have run all tests, even if they take 20 minutes. The staging environment also didn't catch it.

**Manager**: Good analysis. How do we prevent this pattern in the future?

**Engineer**: I could set up automated pre-deployment checks that won't let me skip critical tests.

**Manager**: That's a systemic fix. Also, when you feel time pressure, flag it to me. We can discuss options before cutting corners.

**Engineer**: That makes sense. I was worried about missing the deadline, but causing a production issue was worse.

**Manager**: Exactly. Let's implement the automated checks and establish a clear escalation process for tight deadlines.全
