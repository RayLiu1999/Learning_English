## Dialogue Examples — 實際對話範例

### 🌟 正向回饋 (SBI 模型)

**情境**：經理向團隊成員提供具體的正面回饋

**Manager**: I wanted to give you some feedback about yesterday's client call. When you summarized the technical issue, you broke it down into simple terms and offered three clear solutions.

**Engineer**: Thanks! I was worried it might be too detailed.

**Manager**: Actually, it was perfect. The client visibly relaxed when they understood the problem, and they immediately approved our proposed timeline. Your clear communication directly saved the project.

**Engineer**: I appreciate that feedback. I'll continue using that approach.

---

### 🔧 建設性回饋 (COIN 模型)

**情境**：提供改進建議的回饋對話

**Manager**: I'd like to discuss last week's product demo. I noticed the presentation ran 15 minutes over, which cut our Q&A session short.

**Developer**: You're right, I got carried away with the technical details.

**Manager**: The content was excellent, but timing is crucial. For next time, could we rehearse with a timer and allocate specific minutes to each section?

**Developer**: That makes sense. I'll practice with the timer and tighten my transitions.

---

### 📊 季度績效檢討

**情境**：一對一績效檢討會議

**Manager**: Let's review your Q3 objectives. You exceeded the customer satisfaction target by 15% and delivered all projects on time.

**Employee**: Thank you. I'm particularly proud of the client feedback on the migration project.

**Manager**: That was outstanding work. Where do you feel you could have performed better?

**Employee**: I struggled with the cross-team communication early in the quarter.

**Manager**: I noticed that too, but you improved significantly after we discussed it.

---

### 🎯 目標設定與對齊

**情境**：設定明確的季度目標和期望

**Director**: For Q4, I'd like you to take ownership of the API redesign project.

**Senior Developer**: I'm excited about that. What are the key success metrics?

**Director**: Three main goals: deliver by December 15th, achieve 99.9% backward compatibility, and reduce response times by 40%.

**Developer**: The timeline is tight. Would I have dedicated resources?

**Director**: You'll lead a team of three developers with priority access to DevOps.

---

### 💡 成長機會討論

**情境**：討論職業發展和技能提升

**Employee**: I'd like to discuss my career progression. I'm interested in moving toward a tech lead role.

**Manager**: That's a natural next step. What specific skills do you think you need to develop?

**Employee**: I feel confident technically, but I need more experience with mentoring and architectural decisions.

**Manager**: How about we start by having you mentor our new junior developer?

---

### 🛠️ 改進計劃制定

**情境**：針對具體表現問題制定改進策略

**Manager**: I want to discuss the recent production incident. Walk me through what happened.

**Engineer**: I deployed the fix without running the full test suite. I was focused on getting it out quickly.

**Manager**: I understand the pressure. What could have prevented the issue?

**Engineer**: I could set up automated pre-deployment checks that won't let me skip critical tests.

**Manager**: That's a systemic fix. Let's implement that and establish a clear escalation process.
