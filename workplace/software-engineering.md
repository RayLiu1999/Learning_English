## Dialogue Examples — 實際對話範例

### 🏃‍♂️ 站會對話
**情境**：敏捷開發團隊的每日同步會議

**Scrum Master**: Good morning team. Let's start with Alice.

**Alice (Backend Developer)**: Yesterday I finished the user authentication API. Today I'm working on the frontend integration. No blockers, but I'll need to sync with David on the token format.

**David (Frontend Developer)**: I can walk you through that after standup. The spec is in the PR description, but happy to clarify.

**Tom (QA Engineer)**: I'm writing integration tests for the payment flow. I'll need the staging environment updated with Alice's auth changes.

**Alice**: I'll deploy to staging right after this meeting.

### 🔍 PR 審查對話
**情境**：程式碼審查中的技術討論

**Author (Sarah)**: @reviewers, this PR adds caching for the search endpoint. PTAL when you have a chance.

**Reviewer (Mike)**: Looks good overall! Two questions: what's the cache TTL strategy, and have we considered the memory impact?

**Author**: Good catch—TTL is 5 minutes for search results, and I added memory monitoring. Updated the PR description with the metrics.

**Reviewer**: Perfect. LGTM after you add a unit test for the cache miss scenario.

**Author**: Will do. Should I also add a test for TTL expiration?

**Reviewer**: Yes, that would be comprehensive. Also consider testing concurrent cache writes.

### 🏗️ 架構討論
**情境**：技術選型會議討論系統設計

**Tech Lead (James)**: For the notification service, we're considering a queue-based approach vs real-time WebSockets.

**Engineer 1 (Alex)**: WebSockets give better UX, but queues are more reliable for high volume.

**Engineer 2 (Maya)**: What's our expected message volume?

**Tech Lead**: Peak is around 10K messages per minute. Given that, I'm leaning toward the queue with WebSocket updates for active users only.

**Engineer 1**: That hybrid approach makes sense. We could fall back to polling for inactive sessions.

**Engineer 2**: How do we handle connection failures with WebSockets?

**Tech Lead**: Good point. We'd need exponential backoff and circuit breakers.

### 🚨 生產事故處理
**情境**：緊急修復生產問題的快速協調

**On-call Engineer (Lisa)**: We have elevated 5xx errors on the checkout service. Started 5 minutes ago.

**Site Reliability Engineer (Dan)**: I see the spike. Database connections are maxed out. Could be a connection leak.

**Tech Lead**: Let's roll back the 2 PM deployment first to mitigate. How long to rollback?

**DevOps Engineer (Sam)**: 3 minutes if no DB schema changes. Checking now... no schema changes, we're good to rollback.

**Tech Lead**: Execute the rollback. Lisa, update the incident channel with status.

**Lisa**: Rollback in progress. I'll monitor error rates and update in 5 minutes.

## Useful Patterns
- 站會更新（Yesterday/Today/Blockers）：
  - Yesterday I [completed X]. Today I’ll [work on Y]. Blocked by [Z].
- PR 描述（背景/變更/風險/測試/回滾）：
  - Context: … Changes: … Risks: … Tests: … Rollback plan: …
- 程式碼審查評論：
  - Suggestion: consider … to improve readability.
  - Question: what’s the rationale behind …?
  - Blocking: this can break [case]; propose [fix].
- 架構討論與取捨：
  - Trade-off between [simplicity] and [scalability]; I propose … because …
- 估時與風險：
  - Estimate is [X days] given [scope/dependencies]; risks include …
- 事故溝通：
  - We’re investigating a spike in errors; mitigated by rolling back to v1.2. Next update in 30 minutes.
- 交接與文件：
  - Handover: current status, known issues, runbooks, next steps.

## Context Examples
- PR 描述模板：
  - “Context: Users report timeouts on search. Changes: add caching layer with 5-min TTL. Risks: stale data. Tests: unit + load tests. Rollback: disable via feature flag.”
- 審查評論：
  - “Nit: rename var to isAuthorized for clarity.”／“Could we add a test for empty payload?”
- Commit 訊息（Conventional Commits）：
  - “feat(search): add Redis cache to reduce latency”
  - “fix(api): handle null user in auth middleware”
- 釋出公告（內部）：
  - “v2.3.0 includes rate limiting, expect slight 429 increase during ramp-up.”
- Slack 事故更新：
  - “Mitigated by scaling read replicas; error rate down from 12%→0.5%.”

## Mini Drills
- 寫一段 5 行 PR 描述（含風險與回滾）。
- 把一段模糊回饋改寫為可執行建議（含理由）。
- 30 秒站會更新（含阻礙與請求支援）。
- 寫 2 條 commit 訊息（feat/fix）。

## Quick Reference — 中英雙語卡
- Requesting a review on this PR. 請幫忙審這個 PR。
- Context: … Changes: … 背景：… 變更：…
- Any blockers on your side? 你那邊有阻礙嗎？
- Rolling back via feature flag. 透過功能旗標回滾。
- Mitigated; monitoring errors. 已緩解；持續監控錯誤。
