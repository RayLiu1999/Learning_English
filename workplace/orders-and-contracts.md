## Dialogue Examples — 實際對話範例

### 📋 合約條款討論

**情境**：法務團隊討論合約條款細節

**Client Legal**: We need to modify the liability clause. The current cap is too low.

**Vendor Legal**: What would you consider acceptable? Our standard is annual contract value.

**Client Legal**: Twice the annual value, given the mission-critical nature.

**Vendor Legal**: Could we limit it to direct damages only, excluding consequential losses?

**Client Legal**: Reasonable. Let's also add force majeure coverage.

### 💰 價格與付款條件

**情境**：採購部門與供應商討論商業條款

**Procurement Manager**: The unit pricing seems high. Can you be more competitive?

**Sales Rep**: Our pricing reflects premium service. What areas concern you?

**Procurement**: Your maintenance fee is 25% annually. Our current vendor charges 18%.

**Sales Rep**: We include 24/7 support and guaranteed 4-hour response times.

**Procurement**: Could you offer volume discounts for multi-site deployment?

**Sales Rep**: For a multi-site commitment, I can offer 15% off year two.

### 📅 交期與里程碑

**情境**：專案經理討論交付時程

**Project Manager**: Can we accelerate from 6 months to 4 months?

**Vendor PM**: That's ambitious. What if we run testing in parallel?

**Client PM**: We can assign two full-time business analysts for UAT.

**Vendor PM**: With parallel approach and confirmed resources, we could target 4.5 months.

### 📊 服務等級協議 (SLA)

**情境**：IT 團隊討論系統可用性標準

**IT Director**: The 99.5% uptime SLA is below our standards. We need 99.9%.

**Vendor Engineer**: 99.9% requires redundant infrastructure. That adds 30% to hosting costs.

**IT Director**: We also need response time guarantees under 2 seconds.

**Vendor Engineer**: Let's draft tiered SLAs: standard 99.5% and premium 99.9%.

### 🚀 合約簽署流程

**情境**：完成最終條款談判

**Business Development**: We've resolved all technical terms. Ready for executive review?

**Client Legal**: Yes, but we need board approval for contracts over $500K.

**BD**: Our pricing is valid through month-end. Can we expedite?

**Client Legal**: I'll prepare the board memo today and schedule the meeting for Friday.
