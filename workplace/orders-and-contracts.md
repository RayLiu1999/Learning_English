# Orders & Contracts — 訂單與合約討論英文大全

## Dialogue Examples — 實際對話範例

### 📋 合約條款討論
**情境**：法務團隊討論合約條款細節

**Client Legal**: We need to modify the liability clause. The current cap is too low for our risk profile.

**Vendor Legal**: What would you consider acceptable? Our standard is annual contract value.

**Client Legal**: We're thinking twice the annual value, given the mission-critical nature of this service.

**Vendor Legal**: That's a significant increase. Could we limit it to direct damages only, excluding consequential losses?

**Client Legal**: Reasonable. We'll also need to add force majeure coverage for supply chain disruptions.

**Vendor Legal**: Agreed. Let me draft the revised language and circulate for review.

### 💰 價格與付款條件
**情境**：採購部門與供應商討論商業條款

**Procurement Manager**: The unit pricing seems high compared to our current vendor. Can you be more competitive?

**Sales Rep**: Our pricing reflects the premium service level. What specific areas are you concerned about?

**Procurement**: Your maintenance fee is 25% annually. Our current vendor charges 18%.

**Sales Rep**: True, but we include 24/7 support and guaranteed 4-hour response times. That's not typical at 18%.

**Procurement**: Could you offer volume discounts? We're planning to expand to three more locations.

**Sales Rep**: For a multi-site commitment, I can offer 15% off year two and 20% off year three.

### 📅 交期與里程碑
**情境**：專案經理討論交付時程和關鍵節點

**Project Manager**: The proposed timeline shows go-live in 6 months. Can we accelerate to 4 months?

**Vendor PM**: That's ambitious. The integration phase alone typically takes 8 weeks.

**Client PM**: What if we run testing in parallel with development instead of sequentially?

**Vendor PM**: Parallel testing could save 3 weeks, but we'd need dedicated client resources for UAT.

**Client PM**: We can assign two full-time business analysts. What about hardware procurement?

**Vendor PM**: With parallel approach and confirmed resources, we could target 4.5 months. I'll update the project plan.

### 🔒 保密條款與智慧財產權
**情境**：討論資料保護和IP權利

**Client IP Counsel**: We need to clarify data ownership, especially for derivative works.

**Vendor Legal**: All client data remains your property. Our platform improvements aren't dependent on your specific data.

**Client IP**: What about custom reports we develop together? Who owns those algorithms?

**Vendor Legal**: Joint development would be co-owned. We'd need mutual licensing for each party to use them.

**Client IP**: We prefer exclusive ownership of anything client-specific.

**Vendor Legal**: That's workable for custom features. We'll add a clause defining what constitutes "client-specific."

### 📊 服務等級協議 (SLA)
**情境**：IT團隊討論系統可用性和效能標準

**IT Director**: The 99.5% uptime SLA is below our internal standards. We need 99.9%.

**Vendor Engineer**: 99.9% is achievable but would require redundant infrastructure across three regions.

**IT Manager**: What's the cost impact for the enhanced SLA?

**Vendor Engineer**: Additional infrastructure adds roughly 30% to hosting costs.

**IT Director**: We also need response time guarantees. Under 2 seconds for API calls.

**Vendor Engineer**: Current architecture supports that during normal load. We'd need auto-scaling for peak periods.

**IT Manager**: Let's draft tiered SLAs: standard 99.5% and premium 99.9% with faster response times.

### 🚀 合約簽署流程
**情境**：完成最終條款談判和簽署準備

**Business Development**: We've resolved all technical terms. Are we ready for executive review?

**Client Legal**: Yes, but we need board approval for contracts over $500K. That adds two weeks.

**BD**: Our pricing is valid through month-end. Can we expedite the board process?

**Client Procurement**: We can call an emergency board meeting if needed. What are the final terms?

**BD**: Three-year term, 99.5% SLA, annual price increases capped at 3%, and the liability modifications we discussed.

**Client Legal**: Perfect. I'll prepare the board memo today and schedule the meeting for Friday.

### 📝 合約修訂與續約
**情境**：現有合約到期前的續約討論

**Account Manager**: Your contract expires in 90 days. Let's discuss renewal terms.

**Client Manager**: Overall satisfaction is high, but we want to adjust some service levels.

**AM**: What specific changes are you considering?

**Client Manager**: We need faster implementation support and expanded training programs.

**AM**: We can add a dedicated customer success manager and quarterly training sessions.

**Client Manager**: Pricing for the enhanced package?

**AM**: With the additional services, we're looking at a 15% increase from current rates.

**Client Manager**: That's steep. We've been loyal customers for three years.

**AM**: You're right. For existing customers, I can hold the increase to 8% and include the enhanced services.ocabulary

- 付款與發票：
  - Our standard terms are net 30; is that acceptable?
  - Please include the PO number on the invoice.
- 合約條款：
  - We propose a 12-month term with automatic renewal.
  - Regarding liability, could we cap it at the annual fees?
- 修訂與審閱：
  - Attaching our redlines; key changes are highlighted.
  - Let’s schedule a call to walk through the edits.

## Context Examples
- 供應交期：
  - “Lead time is 4–6 weeks; we can expedite for a fee.” 交期 4–6 週，可加急需付費。
- 條款協商：
  - “To include SLA penalties, we’ll need a higher base price.” 若要違約金，需調高基本費。
- 驗收標準：
  - “Acceptance is upon passing UAT against the agreed criteria.” 驗收以通過 UAT 與標準為準。

## Dialogue Examples — 實際對話範例

### 交期與出貨
Buyer: Can you confirm the earliest ship date?
Vendor: Earliest is the 12th. We can partial ship if that helps your schedule.

### 條款修訂會議
Legal (Client): We’d like to add a confidentiality carve-out for legal compliance.
Legal (Vendor): That’s reasonable. We’ll add a clause allowing disclosures required by law.
