**情境**：初次客戶會議，了解業務需求

**Sales**: Thanks for meeting today. Could you walk me through your current workflow?

**Prospect**: We're using a mix of Excel and email, which creates a lot of manual work.

**Sales**: What's the biggest pain point in that process?

**Prospect**: Definitely report generation. It takes our team two days to compile weekly metrics.
